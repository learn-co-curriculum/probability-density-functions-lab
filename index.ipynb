The trimmed mean avoids being influenced by outlier values by cutting off pre-set amounts from the low and high ends of the data distribution.  For instance, if we wanted to calculate the Trimmed mean of 5%, we would drop the 5% lowest values and 5% highest values, and then calculate the mean of the remaining data.  This is a great way to protect ourselves from outlier values when we need to make use of the mean on datasets that contain many outliers.  Note that the `trim` value is a parameter we can choose--if our dataset is particularly noisy, we may choose to trim 10% or 15%.  \n",
